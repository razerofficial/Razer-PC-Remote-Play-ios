Razer PC Remote Play is derived from moonlight, an open-source project licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.  
Moonlight for iOS is available at [moonlight-android](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios) and Moonlight Common c is available at [moonlight-common-c](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-common-c) 
 
## Modification 
This project includes modified versions of the files in: 
``` 
moonlight-ios/*
``` 
We tried to keep the original Moonlight source code as un-touched as possible, so we kept all the original moonlight-ios folder and strcture. Most of our modifications were made within the neuron folder.
